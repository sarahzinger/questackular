How does the MEAN stack work with Chrome apps?
Can we do Node and Express Chrome?


NOTES:

can have multiple apps running @ same time.
needs manifest.json
background page is running in bg, can do server-type stuff

CAN do ajax reqs to mongo/etc

javascript chrome extensions api<---
chrome IS the server (sort of)

have to put permission that chrome can talk to http/https site
then in angular:
$http.get({params}).then...

content script vs. background script
content script has access to DOM and is sort of the 'client', while
background script is 'server'.


popup script would run as overlay
